# Atlan web app

This is a web-based application designed and implemnted in ReactJS which is capable of running SQL queries and displaying the results of said query.
I have designed my own queries whose query syntax rules are given below:-

## SELECT QUERY

- select all

  -To display all the data present in the table

- select number

  -For example: type "select 5" to get only 5 entries from table

## DELETE Query

- delete all

  -to delete all the data present in table

- delete number

  -For example: type "delete 5" to delete only 5 entries from table

## ADD Query

to insert any new data, the format should be as given below:

- add id:_ name:_ phone:_ age:_

  -"\_"should be replaced by corresponding value

  -For example: add id:7 name:Bivash phone:7250587502 age:23

- Process query: write your query in the input box and then click on "Process Query" to get desired result. \*

## Used Framework

- ReactJS
